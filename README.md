2-dimensional Ising model simulation

100 x 100 lattice ising model approaching equilibrium from an initial random state.

The Metropolis Monte Carlo method is used to solve for the equilibrium state of the lattice.
This method is a type of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method used often in computational physics.
